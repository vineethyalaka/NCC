				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New Community Extended Care Facility offers physical, occupational and speech therapy provided through the staff of Activa Rehabilitation Services. Three nursing home residents recently shared their testimonials on how rehab has put them on a path towards holistic healing.</p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-2454 alignleft" src="http://liqpix.com/T5/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-08-02-at-5.54.56-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-08-02 at 5.54.56 PM" width="177" height="247" srcset="http://newarknursinghome.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-08-02-at-5.54.56-PM.png 177w, http://newarknursinghome.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-08-02-at-5.54.56-PM-107x150.png 107w" sizes="(max-width: 177px) 100vw, 177px" /><br />
<strong>Name:</strong> Peggy Trotman<br />
<strong>Age:</strong> 62</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> Peggy Trotman’s schedule for therapy appointments was intensive: one to two hours a day, six days a week. But the payoff has been priceless, she said. “I feel myself walking better. I’m not stumbling,” she said. Trotman came to NCC Extended Care after dealing with heart issues, dizziness, and getting a pacemaker in February. She had stayed at Extended Care in 2011 and wanted to return a second time for her most recent rehab stint. “Everybody here was so nice, I wanted to come back,” said Trotman, who previously struggled to walk but can now stroll outside with minor assistance from a cane. “I would recommend it to anybody, I really would,” she said of the rehab. “You need to do it in order to get strong and get back your health.”<br />
<img class="size-large wp-image-2453 alignleft" src="http://liqpix.com/T5/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-08-02-at-5.55.03-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-08-02 at 5.55.03 PM" width="175" height="290" srcset="http://newarknursinghome.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-08-02-at-5.55.03-PM.png 175w, http://newarknursinghome.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-08-02-at-5.55.03-PM-91x150.png 91w" sizes="(max-width: 175px) 100vw, 175px" /><br />
<strong>Name:</strong> Kenneth Watson<br />
<strong>Age:</strong> 56</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> A month after Kenneth Watson suffered a stroke, he came to NCC Extended Care with serious challenges. “I couldn’t walk,” recalled Watson, whose speech was also affected by his stroke. Less than two months after his five to six times a week rehab regimen, Watson is back on his feet but it wasn’t without hard work. “I can say that they put me to work but they know their limitations,” he said. “I had a lot of fun. They always made me laugh,” Watson added. Watson’s speech has also improved and he said he’s able to carry on longer conversations with greater ease. “Every day you want to come to therapy because there’s so much love and it makes you want to come,” he said. “I’m going to miss it.”</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2452 alignleft" src="http://liqpix.com/T5/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-08-02-at-5.55.12-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-08-02 at 5.55.12 PM" width="175" height="311" srcset="http://newarknursinghome.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-08-02-at-5.55.12-PM.png 175w, http://newarknursinghome.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-08-02-at-5.55.12-PM-169x300.png 169w, http://newarknursinghome.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-08-02-at-5.55.12-PM-84x150.png 84w" sizes="(max-width: 175px) 100vw, 175px" /><br />
<strong>Name:</strong> Phyllis Burns<br />
<strong>Age:</strong> 54</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> Phyllis Burns says she deals with several different health issues—an irregular heartbeat, arthritis, and being legally blind—so when she fell off her bed at home and blacked out, she needed a lot of support in her recovery. The fall impacted both her left arm and leg, so Burns had to work on small improvements, such as increasing foot movements. “At first, I didn’t want to be here. I was down and out,” she acknowledged. Gradually, as her condition improved, Burns advanced to lifting a bar and focused on regaining her balance. She also found the staff to be her source of support throughout the process. “I call them my angels. They came into my room to encourage me,” she said during her stay at the nursing home.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For Brenda Allen, the good old days are literally flashing before her eyes.</p>
<p>Allen is a resident of New Community Extended Care Facility, a skilled nursing facility in Newark that recently completed a significant upgrade to its amenities: flat screen televisions are now featured in every residents’ room. Each television has access to 48 cable channels, including popular options such as the Food Network, Comedy Central, ESPN, BET, Lifetime and more.</p>
<p>On a recent afternoon, Allen reclined in her bed while watching an episode of the “Andy Griffith Show” on TV Land.</p>
<p>“I like that stuff,” she said with a grin. As of January, every resident’s room at the 180-bed capacity nursing home located at 266 South Orange Ave. in Newark was outfitted with a 32-inch Samsung flat screen television, Facility Administrator Robert Smolin said. The glossy, black-framed televisions are mounted on the wall in front of each resident’s bed, allowing for easy viewing access.</p>
<p>“It’s an improvement over all these years,” said Sharon Grant, a licensed practical nurse who has worked at Extended Care for 20 years. “The residents seem to be excited,” she added.</p>
<p>The effort to outfit the entire four-story nursing home with televisions started back in 2014, according to Smolin. He worked closely with the NCC departments of Environmental Services, to purchase the televisions, and Information Technology, to get the building wired and connected to DirecTV.</p>
<p>Previously, if a resident wanted to enjoy a show, they were allowed to bring in their own television set. However, this also required an antenna and a converter box for the televisions, many of which did not produce clear images. Now, the pictures on every screen are crisp and each resident has control of a remote with a built-in speaker that allows for clear audio as well.</p>
<p>“I think it’s a big change. It’s a historic day,” Smolin said.</p>
<p>President of the Resident Association Robert Cook enjoys watching crime shows and described his viewing experience as “very clear and the sound is good.”</p>
<p>Smolin noted that watching television, in addition to providing a source of entertainment and information to both long term and short term nursing home residents, can also serve as “a psychological comfort.” Spanish-speaking channels are also among the options offered to residents.</p>
<p>“As a baby boomer, I really like TV,” he added, “whether it’s watching a movie, comedy or sports.”</p>
<p>Randy Curry, a resident on the second floor, now looks forward to watching the morning and evening news. “It’s real great,” he said enthusiastically.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">D</span>uring the summer, Wayne Bullock was in a world of pain.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But a mere three weeks of physical therapy at the New Community Extended Care Facility made a world of difference for the 57-year-old Newark resident.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I couldn’t walk, I couldn’t bend,” Bullock recalled. But his progress since then has been remarkable, he noted. “I went from a wheelchair to a walker to a cane,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After being discharged from Saint Michael’s Medical Center in August, Bullock came to the New Community Extended Care Facility for rehabilitation. Previously, Bullock said he had health issues with his liver that also impacted his mobility.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I couldn’t bend my legs but I said, it’ll pass,” he said. But suddenly one day, his legs collapsed, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“My legs were like the scarecrow from the Wizard of Oz,” Bullock said with a chuckle. “I thought in my mind that I would never walk again.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Staff at Saint Michael’s referred Bullock to Extended Care, where he came into the care of Occupational Therapist Janneth Gallosa.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The next three weeks were marked by intensive rehab sessions—two hours a day for five days a week.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In just the first week and a half, she said, Bullock made “big strides.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“If I tell him to lift up his leg, he’ll always do it. He won’t argue with me,” Gallosa said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“That’s why his progress was really fast,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In addition to his liver condition, Bullock faced other health challenges. At age 35, he went on disability after his lung had collapsed. He had led an active life, having majored in physical education in college and taught gymnastics. Previously, he also worked for Blue Cross Blue Shield as a word processor and worked a side gig teaching a middle school gymnastics squad in East Orange.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Now at home, Bullock said he plans to continue with exercises, such as throwing a ball against a wall, going up steps and walking without the assistance of a cane.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">He stride has gotten stronger and his footing surer each day.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I had to prove to myself I’m going to walk again,” he said. “I started in a wheelchair.”</span></p>

		<title>Extreme Makeover: Rehabilitation Therapy Gets A New Look</title>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I</span><span class="s1">f you haven’t seen the upgraded rehabilitation therapy room at New Community Extended Care Facility recently, the staff would welcome you to stop by.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">They are eager to show off the renovated space, located on the first floor of the skilled nursing facility at 266 South Orange St. in Newark. As you will see, the changes are quite dramatic.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The rehabilitation services provided by Activa Rehab at Extended Care include physical, occupational and speech therapies. The team of therapists is dedicated to providing the highest quality care while maintaining a healing touch.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The rehab space now boasts a new kitchen, bedroom and bathroom—all designed to mimic a realistic house-like environment, Facility Administrator Robert Smolin said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We’re hoping that the rehab is just like a person’s apartment where they can relearn the skills needed to quickly get back home,” he said. “You get robbed of that from an injury or a disease,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The bedroom has a twin bed and matching wooden dresser, complete with accents like framed pictures. Here residents rehearse daily tasks such as transferring from the bed to a wheelchair or other walking assistance device, and vice versa.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At the kitchen, residents build up their tolerance of standing, said Toa Zoko, physical therapist assistant. Residents also employ their fine motor skills to adjust the knobs on the stove, turn on the faucet, heat leftovers in the microwave or open the refrigerator.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the bathroom, which features a full tub and toilet, residents practice movements such as tub transfers. Getting more comfortable with the motions helps lessen any anxieties or fear of slipping once an individual is on his or her own, Janneth Gallosa, an occupational therapist, noted.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“They were so happy that they got this,” Gallosa said of the reaction from residents. The newly installed simulation spaces greatly expand the range of therapy activities provided at Extended Care. The renovations were completed by Environmental Services in the span of about two to three weeks, according to Smolin.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Arlene George said she began going to physical therapy at Extended Care in December of 2015 after having her left leg amputated. She works with the therapists for at least one-and-a-half to two hours each day.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“They always say take your time, have patience, everything will work out fine,” said George, a 41-year-old resident of Newark.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A native of the Virgin Islands, George said that the new features are a big plus for rehab patients. “I use everything,” she said. “It’s great.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The makeover, which included new paint throughout the space, builds upon previous upgrades to the rehab room. Last September, Extended Care received a donated elliptical machine and home gym from a local resident who was moving out of state. Gallosa said that the machines provide more exercise options for higher functioning residents, such as middle-aged adults.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The completed renovations to the first floor rehabilitation therapy room complement other upgrades that have taken place around the 180-bed capacity nursing home. In January, every resident’s room received brand new flat screen televisions with access to 48 cable channels.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For more information on rehabilitation therapy, call Extended Care at 973-624-2020.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">N</span><span class="s1">ew Community Extended Care Facility, a non-profit skilled nursing center at 266 South Orange Ave. in Newark, has achieved an overall five star rating—the highest possible score for a nursing home—from Medicare.gov.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The new rating catapults Extended Care to the top of the list of quality nursing homes in Newark, according to Administrator Robert Smolin.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“We’re the only five star (facility) in the city of Newark,” Smolin said.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Medicare.gov releases ratings for nursing homes across the United States on a quarterly basis via Nursing Home Compare, an online database that’s accessible to the public and shows how many stars a nursing home has achieved (on a scale of one to five) in the following three areas: quality measures, staffing and health inspections.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Located in the heart of Newark in the city’s Central Ward, New Community Extended Care Facility was established in 1986 and has built a reputation of providing quality, holistic care to the most vulnerable residents in the community.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“The people we serve are people who have been through a lot,” Director of Nursing Veronica Onwunaka said. Many people who come to Extended Care have dealt with major health challenges, whether related to chronic illness or general aging.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“We look beyond that—we look at where they are coming from, what they <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>have been through in life,” Onwunaka said, referring to the comprehensive approach that the staff use to care for a person’s body, mind and spirit.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Lillian Morales, 65, is president of the Extended Care Resident Council and said that she was thrilled to learn that the facility she’s called home for the last six years scored high marks.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“I know they have the best nurses. The nurses are very competent,” Morales said. “I’m pretty comfortable,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Previously, Extended Care was rated as an overall four-star facility, with five stars in the category of quality measures.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“I’m happy they have a five star rating. They worked hard for it,” Morales, a Newark resident, said.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Onwunaka has worked at Extended Care for about 25 years and said that the improved rating that NCC earned “builds courage and confidence” among her staff. “If I keep doing good, I could achieve more,” she said of the message that the five star rating sends to employees.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“I was very happy. I want my staff to have the fulfillment that their hard work eventually paid off,” Onwunaka added.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In addition to acknowledging the role of the nursing home’s residents and staff, Onwunaka emphasized that each family member plays an important role in creating a successful plan of care for the residents.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“It took everyone—residents, families and staff—in order to get it done,” Onwunaka said of achieving the five star rating.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“I think they deserve a big applause,” she said of the families who entrust their loved ones to the caring and professional staff at New Community Extended Care Facility. “It takes a lot for somebody to trust you,” she said.</span></p>
